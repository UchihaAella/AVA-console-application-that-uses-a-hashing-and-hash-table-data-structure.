Student Grade Tracker Documentation

Introduction

The Student Grade Tracker is a Java console application that uses a hash table (via HashMap) to manage and track student grades. It is designed for quick and efficient handling of student records.

Features

1.	Add Student and Grade: Store a new student's name and grade.
2.	Update Grade: Modify an existing student's grade.
3.	View All Records: Display all students and their grades.
4.	Search Grade: Find a student's grade by name.
5.	Delete Record: Remove a student and their grade.
6.	Exit: Close the program.
   
This tool simplifies grade management with fast data retrieval and updates.

Why I Made This Application

I created the Student Grade Tracker to demonstrate how hashing and hash tables can efficiently manage real-world data, like student grades, while also serving as a simple, practical tool.

How It Contributes

•	To Me: Enhances my programming and problem-solving skills while reinforcing knowledge of data structures.
•	To the Community: Provides educators, students, and developers with a straightforward tool for grade management and learning about hash tables in action.
